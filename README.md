# Web3 and Blockchain Development Branch (`master`)

⚠️ **This branch is dedicated to active development of Web3 and blockchain-related features.** For stable and production-ready code, please refer to the `main` branch.

---

## Overview

This branch serves as the primary workspace for ongoing development, testing, and experimentation within the context of decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain integrations.  
Changes committed here may be incomplete, unstable, or under active testing.

---

## Purpose

- **Isolate experimental and development work from production.**
- **Iterate on smart contract logic, Web3 integrations, and backend connectivity.**
- **Safely explore new ideas before promotion to the main branch.**

---

## Guidelines

- Ensure code is logically structured and tested before committing.
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Create feature branches for major changes.
- Avoid pushing directly to `main`; use `master` for staging and iteration.

---

## Notes

When features in `master` are finalized and verified, they may be merged into `main` as part of a release cycle or production deployment.
